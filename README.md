**WeatherZen** is a single-page application for accepting sky condition observations at a given latitude and longitude. To create a new observation simply click on the **Create** icon on the upper-right corner of the observation display and enter a new latitude, longitude and sky condition. When you click **Submit** the observation will be saved and timestamped. If you do not wish to submit an observation simply click **Cancel**.

After clicking either **Submit** or **Cancel** you will be automatically redirected to the observation display list. If you wish to edit the observation simply click on the **Edit** link and you will be directed to the Edit Observation page for the appropriate Observation Id. You may change the existing Latitude, Longitude or Sky Conditions observation at this time. Upon clicking **Submit** your observation will be updated along with a new timestamp.

Technologies utilized: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Knex library](https://knexjs.org/)
